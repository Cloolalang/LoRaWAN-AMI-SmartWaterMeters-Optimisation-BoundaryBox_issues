This repo is under-construction.

Brief:

As part of a larger study to document system design optimisation of LoRaWAN networks for AMI water-metering (Smart water meters).

This part will address the issue of installing LoRaWAN End-devices into sub-surface meter pits or boundary boxes and the RF attenuating effects thereof.

Notes;

1) Boundary box phyical dimentions, materials, lids and man-hole covers.
2) Meter antenna type, placement, ground-plane, performance, de-tuning. s-paramaters, radiation pattern
3) Basic attenuation calculations
4) RF coverage planning  - recommended configuration and input data, survey test standard measurements, validation of coverage analysis.
5) Environmental variables - weather and FOD, seasonal
6) End-device SF/ADR restrictions to preserve battery life, at the expence of link budget - thus forcing the requirement for lower gateway int-ersite distance, (more gateways per given geography).
7) Methods of improving link budget for this use-case, including plactic box/chambe/pit lids, through-the-lid antennas, etc.
8) Effects of frost covers, meter risers etc.
9) CW testing
10) Test setup calibration, test antennas and E2E LoRaWAAN network
