Some example questions;


1) What attenuation figure should be used when planning LoRaWAN RF coverage of a proposed gateway, where the End-device will be installed into an enclosed meter pit / boundary box with a metal lid?
 - Answer: in dB when compared to a standard outdoor measurement at 1.5m above ground level.
  -Example: 22dB (+/- 5dB).
2) Above for plastic lid.
3) Considering the above answers, and an installation margin of 10dB and a slow-fading margin of 6dB,  what is the expected gateway geographical serving area for this type of end-device in a typical flat, urban area where the gateway antenna is 6dBi gain mounted at 9m above ground level?
4) Above for SF12 and SF9?
5) In the case of above with SF9, what is the optimal inter-site distance for a network where each end-device with be served with a macro-diversity and redundency of minimum 2 gateways?
6) Is it possible to determin a formula for determining coverage area
